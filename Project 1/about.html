    <p> My name's Meet. I'm very passionate about writing, reading, and technology. This website is going to serve as an intersection of all those things. As someone who works in tech and goes to school for it, I find myself aware of the misnomer that those of us who code or work with numbers can't enjoy literature, or the arts on a broader scale.</p>
